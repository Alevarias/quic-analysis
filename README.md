## How to install dependencies: 
1. Wireshark + tshark
- Using the link (https://www.wireshark.org/download.html), you can download a wireshark_installer.exe file which makes the download easy. In the options when downloading, you'll need to also ensure that tshark is selected to download as well. 
2. Wireshark Path
- Update the wireshark path if it isn't already updated.
- If you've installed wireshark in the default location, you can use the following instructions to add the wireshark path: Settings > System Properties > Environment Variables > System Variables > Path > New > C:\Program Files\Wireshark
3. Python Libraries
- You can install the dependencies by downloading the requirements.txt and using the bash command: pip install -r requirements.txt. 

## How to execute the code: 
- The main tool is the live_quic_reader.py script. You can either open it up in an IDE and run it from there or use the terminal with the command: python3 live_quic_reader.py. After running the code, the listener will be on and searching for packets being transmitted across the wifi network. 

## How to test or validate the results
- Testing and validation can be done through using another device to search up one of the following websites while the code is running. The script will then print its guess as to what website is being accessed through quic. 
["https://www.google.com", "https://www.facebook.com", "https://www.youtube.com", "https://www.amazon.com", "https://www.yahoo.com", "https://www.twitter.com", "https://www.instagram.com", "https://www.linkedin.com", "https://chatgpt.com/", "https://www.cnn.com"]
- Validation is also done with a testing set in every training epoch. The trainer is the quic_cnn_trainer.py, and you can use it to see how the accuracy increases along with the epochs. 

## Explanation of folder structure
- There is only once folder, and it's the folder that holds the training .pcap files generated by the selenium_generator.py script. 
- The other data-related files to pay attention to are the best_model.pth and the pcap_data.csv which are both locateed in the main directory.
